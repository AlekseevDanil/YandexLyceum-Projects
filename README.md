# YandexLyceum Projects üñ•


Yandex Academy Lyceum is a free two-year educational program opened and developed with the support of Yandex at SHAD in 2016. It is a structural subdivision of Yandex Academy.\
In this repository I have collected my big projects from all the time I studied. To see them, hop through the branches.\

‚ùïPlease don't be harsh on my code, file formation or anything else, at the time I created any project in this repository I was a student and didn't know much, but I tried to improve my development skills. So I decided to leave all the code as it is, so you can compare it to my recent work and see the growth. *I hope you have fun! :)*
